                        The general answer is definitely “no”.

I remember seeing a movie once where two people needed to hack “harder” to “keep out some intruder” and they just started slamming on one keyboard with four hands instead of two. I think this is the most extreme example of the common perception.<br><br>
                        Real programming is much slower than most people perceive and therefore extraordinarily expensive. Creating, for example, a 1,000,000 line codebase of useful code literally requires close to 1,000 engineers. It is not like writing a large novel, for example.<br><br>
                        It also involves a lot of other activities besides typing (and typing code). Designs and test plans must be created and reviewed, testing must be conducted, and operational       activities like tuning and monitoring must be conducted as well; much of this takes the form of typing narrative descriptions of one’s intent, then presenting them to a larger team, or doing things like pouring over logs to find bugs.
